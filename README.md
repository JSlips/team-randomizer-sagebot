This Discord bot is designed to enhance the gaming experience on Discord servers by automatically dividing participants in a voice channel into two equal-sized teams for video games. Upon receiving the command .gen, the bot accesses the list of members in the user's voice channel, randomly shuffles the participants, and then splits them into two teams. If the number of members is even, both teams will have an equal number of players. If odd, one team will have one more player than the other, decided randomly. The bot then announces the team division through an embedded message in the text channel, highlighting "Team 1" and "Team 2" with the names of assigned members, enhancing the gaming session setup process with efficiency and fairness. This bot demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, asynchronous programming with asyncio, the use of third-party libraries (discord.py), and implementing logical algorithms for team division.
